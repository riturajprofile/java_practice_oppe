# java_practice_oppe

A simple Java practice repository for getting started with editing and creating files, along with basic editor tips.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a starting point for practicing Java-related tasks including creating new files and editing existing ones. It also includes a short note about keyboard shortcuts to improve editing efficiency.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (or download the project files).
2. Open your preferred Java IDE or editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).
3. Create or edit Java files as needed to complete exercises or practice tasks.

## How to Create a New File

- In this project, you can create a new Java file to practice writing code.
- To keep organization consistent, place new files in a descriptive package or directory, e.g., `src/com/yourname/` or `src/`.
- Example:
  - Create: `src/com/example/HelloWorld.java`
  - Content:
    ```java
    package com.example;

    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, world!");
        }
    }
    ```

## Editing Tips

- The repository notes mention basic editor keyboard shortcuts to improve navigation and editing speed:
  - Use Control + Shift + m to toggle the tab key moving focus.
  - Alternatively, press Escape, then Tab to move to the next interactive element on the page.

> Note: Keyboard shortcuts can vary by editor. If you’re using a different editor, check its documentation for equivalent navigation shortcuts.

## Editor Shortcuts Reference (General)

- Move focus or caret:
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + M` (tabbing focus in some editors)
  - macOS: `Cmd + Shift + M` (or your editor’s equivalent)
- Jump to next interactive element:
  - `Esc` then `Tab` (in some editors and web UIs)
- Save:
  - `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + S` (macOS)
- Compile/Run Java:
  - IDE-specific (e.g., Run button)
  - Command line:  
    ```bash
    javac HelloWorld.java
    java HelloWorld
    ```

## Project Structure (Suggested)

- `src/` — Java source files
  - `com/yourname/` — Your package structure
- `README.md` — This file
- `LICENSE` — (optional) license for your code
- `docs/` — (optional) any project documentation
- `tests/` — (optional) unit tests

## Contributing

If you’d like to contribute:
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature/bugfix branch
- Write tests where applicable
- Submit a pull request

## License

Include an appropriate license if this is for sharing or collaboration (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). If not applicable, you can omit this section.

If you want the README tailored to a specific exercise, a particular Java topic (e.g., classes and objects, interfaces, streams), or to reflect the exact folder structure you’ll use, share a few details and I’ll customize it.
